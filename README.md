# PythonForEverybody
## Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)
**</br>Complete This Course and understand my FIRST coding language**
## Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)
</br>*Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) 
</br>Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures: *SWEBOK text (from chapter 13.6) informed us on the multiple types of text we will learn about through algortihms and their different methods of execution. Even in class on 10-1-19, we went over in creative ways the type of algorithms a machine language can intake, how they naturally intake and execute a level of code (example: writing a psuedo-code to CORRECTLY make a PB&J sandwich), and how that input needs to be specific in order for a computer to execute that task in that expected way.*
## Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)
</br>*My own application for data retrieval and processing.*
</br>*Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.*
Screenshots and work through IDLE or PyCharm are being uploaded periodically.
## Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system)
</br>*I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification. Note: this course has been audited and worked on weekly outside of class to complete the course work that is being worked on in tandem with my actual COP 1500 class.*
## Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)
</br>*The courses will be available for the duration of the semester (specifically until the end of November)
</br>I have all required software.(IDLE, PyCharm, etc.)
</br>I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.*
## Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)
</br>*Professor - for grade
</br>Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud
</br>Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job*
## Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)Week: 
</br>*Chapter One - Why we Program? (3 hours)
</br>Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions (3 hours)
</br>Chapter Three: Conditional Code (3 hours)
I already had a good grasp on the initial intro for python from our activities in class; yet, the Hardware part of the copmuter's cPU, MOBO, etc. I had from tech field experience and current experience in the job I have now. I was also able to do the quiz, without essentially being able to submit it as I used the wonderful Snipping Tool I've been using since I started my tech carreer
</br>Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration (3 hours)
This week, besides the one we learned about input, has got to be the most important when it comes to me being able to use this information for my Integration Project. I honestly am having a good time going through and ensuring that I know what I'm doing and learning someting I thought I would NOT be able to do. Very very useful for making sure any invalid inputs 
</br>Chapter Four: Functions (2 hours)
Going through with my online course with Michigan and also in class work with my integration project, functions have been used to recall more than one program essentially within one file of code. I enjoy the void function myself, but you can make your function more intricate as time goes on and you experiment more with your files. My integration project has been added to have more than one game when you win or lose; for now, it's jsut a dice rolling game.
</br>Chapter Seven: Files (3 hours)
</br>Chapter Eight: Lists (3 hours)
Lists help give a single variable multiple outputs within a print or "recall" option if it is in a function. With lists, you can navigate through which variable you want to get or print by giving a number, both positive and negative,after naming the variable in the print statement; this is called 'indexing'.For example, you could list a variable and want the 3rd outcome; it would look like "print(item[1])" and that would print out the SECOND variable since it always starts with 0.
</br>Chapter Six: Strings (3 hours)
Strings are actually touched upon on the earlier weeks; this week merely serving as review for the weeks we spent in class and outside with my integration project
</br>Chapter Nine: Dictionaries (3 hours)
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’.
</br>Chapter Ten: Tuples (2 hours)
</br>Graduation and work on independent program (2 hours)
I have been able to get my project done about halfway, only scoring 90's for the 2/3 entries needed for the course. I am determined to make the final one incredible enough to get the 100/100. That being said, I still enjoy doing my Choose your Own Adventure Game.
</br>Complete independent program (2 hours)*
